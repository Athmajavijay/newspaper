    <h1>Student Migration in Kerala</h1>

    <p>There is a significant increase in the number of students migrating overseas for education, rising from
        129,000
        in 2018 to 250,000 in 2023. This trend is attributed to factors such as economic stagnation, limited
        living
        standards, and a desire for a more liberal environment. The opposition has criticized the government's
        perceived
        apathy towards this "unregulated" migration, highlighting its social and economic impacts, including
        substantial
        financial outflows from the state.Student migration from Kerala has been increasing due to various
        factors such
        as limited higher education opportunities, better career prospects, and superior academic facilities in
        other
        states and countries. Many students move abroad or to other parts of India seeking quality education,
        advanced
        research opportunities, and higher employability. The tough competition for seats in Kerala's premier
        institutions, along with attractive scholarships and financial aid from foreign universities, further
        accelerates this trend. While migration opens doors to global exposure and better living standards, it
        also
        leads to brain drain, economic strain on families, and declining enrollments in local institutions. To
        address
        this issue, Kerala needs to improve its higher education infrastructure, introduce diverse academic
        programs,
        and create better job opportunities to retain its young talent within the state
